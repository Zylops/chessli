## Acknowledgments

|  | Acknowledgements |
| --- | --- |
| [`Lichess`](https://lichess.org) | A free, no-ads, open source chess server that let's everyone play chess! Think about whether to [become a patron](https://lichess.org/patron)! :) |
| [`Anki`](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) | A free and open-source flashcard program using spaced-repetition, a technique from cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization.  I couldn't imagine learning without it anymore. |
| [`Anki Card Templates`](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1082754005) | The interactive chess functionality on Chessli's anki cards is based from [these fantastic cards](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1082754005).|
| [`python-chess`](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) | Most of the heavy lifting, e.g. parsing games, finding mistakes, extracting openings, etc. is done with `python-chess`. |
| [`berserk`](https://github.com/rhgrant10/berserk) |  The communication between `lichess` and `chessli` is performed via `berserk` |
| [`typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) | The `chessli` `cli` is built with the great `typer` |
| [`rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) | The rich colors and fancy tables are made possible by `rich` |
| [`apy`](https://github.com/lervag/apy/) | Importing cards directly into anki without csv-export can be done via `apy` |
